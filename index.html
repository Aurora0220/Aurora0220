<h1><b><font color="navy">Who am I</font><b></h1></p>
<p>Iâ€™m a girl who loves to solve puzzles, something about reasoning always attracts my attention. Reading takes up most of my time after school. In contrast to the young adult novels that most teenagers read, I prefer to read mystery novels. From Japanese writer Keigo Higashino to British writer Agatha Christie, I like to immerse myself in the text, follow the author's perspective to feel and try to solve the mystery and solve the unsolved case. I also like to watch suspenseful science fiction films and episodes like Inception and Sherlock series. I like to be inspired by these films and TV works. I love the thrill I get when I pull the information provided and reason it out step by step to get results. In my academic life as well, I prefer to output my ideas after thinking through my brain rather than just memorizing them. I am good at critical thinking because I like the process of thinking. And I like to see things from all angles because sometimes different angles bring us different inspirations. </p>

<p>After reading the information about the ETBD department on the university's official website, I learned that the ETBD  is a department that mainly leads students to study emerging technologies. Not only that, but ETBD is also an interdisciplinary program that allows me to study not only data science, engineering, and programming but also arts and humanities. I want to master multiple disciplines and apply them in combination rather than delving into a single discipline. My dream is to make a suspense-oriented game. Because compared with the text and film and television works, the game can give the player a more immersive feeling. Additionally, the game gives the player more freedom to collect clues and make deductions, rather than being limited to the perspective given by the author or director in books and movies. I am a fan of mystery games myself, so I would be lucky if I had the opportunity to study game development in college. I would be 100% passionate about it because it's something I'm interested in. The UI/UX and VR taught by the ETBD department can also greatly enrich the variety of games and enhance the playability of games</p> 

<h1><b><font color="navy">What interests me most about Digital and Emerging Technology</font><b></h1>
<p>The most attractive part for me is VR. Before I entered college, I was uncertain about my goals. I probably just want to learn to program in college. However, one weekend during my freshman year, my friend and I went to a VR experience. There I experienced the general feeling of immersive gaming for the first time. I remember I was sitting on a roller coaster and the scenery flew past me all the way and it was as if I could hear the wind whistling past. When I looked up I could see the sky and the buildings beside me seemed to be standing real. So, I have a strong interest in VR. Because VR brings us a 3D or even 4D experience that exceeds 2D. The interaction between us and the game is not limited to moving the mouse, we can move our eyes to change the angle, use the handle or even other accessories to interact, and move the body to switch scenes. All of these can make the game more realistic, thus greatly increasing the playability of the game. And VR technology can make show more scenes like space, which is much better than just through the flat display.</p>
