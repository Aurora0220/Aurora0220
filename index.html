<p>Iâ€™m a girl who loves to solve puzzles, something about reasoning always attracts my attention Reading takes up most of my time after school. In contrast to the young adult novels that most teenagers read, I prefer to read mystery novels. From Japanese writer Keigo Higashino to Britishwriter Agatha Christie, I like to immerse myself in the text, follow the author's perspective to feel and try to solve the mystery and solve the unsolved case. I also like to watch suspenseful science fiction films and episodes like Inception and Sherlock series.I love the thrill I get when I pull the information provided and reason it out step by step to get results.
